I'm a software developer with {0} years of experience, focusing mainly on Python and React.  I directly contributed to a $100m acquisition as part of a small engineering team at a restaurant tech startup.  Most of what I've worked on has been high-throughput webapps dealing with large volumes of data and a globally-distributed customer base.  Most of my time has been spent working with APIs, building out both internal and external APIs as well as webhooks and integrating with 3rd party systems.  I prefer building end-user applications to internal tools.  I've worked remote for the past {1} years.

When I'm not coding, I can probably be found playing Factorio or reading speculative fiction (Bobiverse and Cradle are personal favorites).  In my off time, I enjoy fencing, I play piano, and I run tabletop games for some local friends on a regular basis.
