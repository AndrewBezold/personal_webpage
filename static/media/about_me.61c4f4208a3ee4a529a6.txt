I'm a software developer with ${years_experience} years of experience, focusing mainly on Python and React.  I was part of a small engineering team at a startup that got acquired (better wording).  I've worked remote for the past ${years_remote} years.  (a little more about my experience here.)  I enjoy fencing, I play piano, and I run tabletop games for some local friends on a regular basis.
